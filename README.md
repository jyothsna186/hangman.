The Hangman game is a timeless and engaging word-guessing game that challenges a player’s vocabulary, memory, and problem-solving skills.This discusses the design, functionality, and educational value
of a console-based Hangman game developed using the Java programming language.
At its core, the game revolves around a simple yet captivating objective — to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time, 
within a limited number of attempts. The game begins by prompting the user to enter their name, creating a personalized and interactive experience. After this warm welcome, the program selects a random 
word from a predefined list that includes terms such as “computer,” “python,” and “science.” 
This element of randomness ensures that each playthrough is unique, maintaining the game’s replayability.
Once the word is chosen, the game displays blank spaces that represent each letter of the word. 
The player then begins to guess individual characters. Correct guesses reveal the positions of those letters 
in the word, while incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining attempts.
The player is allowed a total of 12 incorrect guesses before the game ends in a loss. If the player successfully guesses all the letters of the word before exhausting their attempts, they are congratulated with a winning message.The game is implemented using basic Java programming constructs such as arrays, loops, conditional
statements, string manipulation, and user input handling through the Scanner class. The use of a StringBuilder to store guessed letters allows the program to efficiently check whether a letter has already 
been guessed and to display the current state ofthe word after each attempt. The random word selection is handled using Java’s Random class, which adds unpredictability and fun to the game.From an educational
perspective, developing the Hangman game in Java is an excellent way to practice fundamental programming concepts. It teaches how to manage user input, how to work with strings and characters, how to implement 
game logic, and how to use loops effectively. It also introduces basic error handling and program flow control in a way that is accessible to beginner and intermediate programmers.
In conclusion, this Java-based Hangman game is not only an entertaining project but also a valuable learning tool. It demonstrates how a simple concept can be transformed into an interactive application using 
fundamental programming skills. The game’s straightforward logic, combined with its engaging gameplay, makes it a great example of how coding can bring traditional games to life in the digital world.
